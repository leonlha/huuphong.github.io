### PSO-Convolutional Neural Networks with Heterogeneous Learning Rate

Development of a distributed collaborative learning framework for image classification by proposing a novel formulation called Dynamics1 and Dynamics2. This formulation incorporates distilled Cuckoo-Smale elements into the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, using K-Nearest Neighbors in convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
