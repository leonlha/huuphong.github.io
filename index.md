### PSO-Convolutional Neural Networks with Heterogeneous Learning Rate

The creation of a distributed collaborative learning framework for image classification is achieved through the introduction of a new approach known as Dynamics 1 and Dynamics 2. This innovative formulation integrates refined Cuckoo-Smale elements into the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, leveraging the power of K-Nearest Neighbors within convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

### An Improvement for Capsule Networks Using Depthwise Separable Convolution

The proposal introduces a novel approach in the Capsule Networks architecture by replacing the Standard Convolution with a Depthwise Separable Convolution. This innovative design offers several benefits, including a substantial reduction in the total number of parameters in the model, improved stability, and competitive accuracy. The proposed modification aims to optimize the performance of Capsule Networks by leveraging the advantages of Depthwise Separable Convolutions.
